I obtained my MSc and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from KU Leuven, Belgium, in 2013 and 2018, respectively. During my PhD research, I focused on trajectory learning, recognition, and generalization in robot programming by demonstration, which was achieved by integrating concepts from differential geometry, screw theory, and optimal control. 

I am currently working in the [Robotgenskill project](https://robotgenskill.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) which focusses on the generalization of human-demonstrated robot skills. The project is an ERC Advanced Grant, led by [Prof. Joris De Schutter](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00011419), proposed based on the preliminary results obtained in my doctoral research.

I am co-promotor of two PhD candidates:
- [Arno Verduyn](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0140902): *Analysis and generalization of human-demonstrated skills using coordinate-invariant shape descriptors*
- [Riccardo Burlizzi](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0148800): *Using invariant theory to extend the generalization capabilities of robot learning from demonstration methodologies*

My current research interests include intent estimation, trajectory generation, and reactive control in human-robot interaction.

In my research I make use of the following specialized software tools: [eTaSL](https://etasl.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/), [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/),  [ROS](https://www.ros.org/), [Orocos](https://orocos.org/)

## About

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate within the <a href='https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/robotics'>Robotics Research Group</a> at <a href='https://www.kuleuven.be'>KU Leuven</a>. My research interests include learning by demonstration, optimal control, screw theory and estimation to support the programming of robots in interaction with humans.

## Biography

I obtained my MSc and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from KU Leuven, Belgium, in 2013 and 2018, respectively. During my PhD research, I focused on trajectory learning, recognition, and generalization in robot programming by demonstration, which was achieved by integrating concepts from differential geometry, screw theory, and optimal control. 

I am currently working in the [Robotgenskill project](https://robotgenskill.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) which focusses on the generalization of human-demonstrated robot skills. The project is an ERC Advanced Grant, led by [Prof. Joris De Schutter](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00011419), which was proposed based on the preliminary results obtained in my doctoral research.

## Students

I am the co-promotor of two PhD candidates:
- [Arno Verduyn](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0140902). Topic: Analysis and generalization of human-demonstrated skills using coordinate-invariant shape descriptors
- [Riccardo Burlizzi](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0148800). Topic: Using invariant theory to extend the generalization capabilities of robot learning from demonstration methodologies

I have mentored and co-supervised over 15 master thesis students in the Master of Mechanical Engineering programme (and the Master of Artificial Intelligence) at KU Leuven.

## Software

For my research on invariant trajectory descriptors, I am developing software packages in Matlab and Python: [invariants_mat](https://github.com/maximvochten/invariants_mat) and [invariants_py](https://github.com/maximvochten/invariants_py).  These packages support the robust numerical calculation of invariant descriptors and also support the generation of trajectories in an invariant way.

In my research I frequently make use of the following specialized software tools for robotics: 
- [eTaSL](https://etasl.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) for task specification and reactive sensor-based control
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) for solving optimal control problems and nonlinear optimization problems
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) for building robotics applications integrating sensing, motion generation, control, and visualization
- [Orocos](https://orocos.org/) for building fast robot controllers

## About

I am a Senior Researcher within the [Robotics & Autonomous Systems unit](https://mecatron.rma.ac.be/) at the [Royal Military Academy](https://www.rma.ac.be/en) (RMA), Belgium.

I lead the team at RMA within the European Defense Funds project [GENIUS](https://mecatron.rma.ac.be/index.php/projects/genius/) on robotic demining. 

## Robot demining

In the [GENIUS](https://mecatron.rma.ac.be/index.php/projects/genius/) project on robotic demining, we research robotic technologies that can improve the speed and safety of detecting and disposing of land mines.

## Invariant trajectory representations

From 2018-2024, I was mainly active on the [Robotgenskill project](https://robotgenskill.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) which focuses on the generalization of human-demonstrated robot skills. The main aim was to develop techniques to learn data-efficient task representations from sparse human demonstrations by exploiting coordinate-invariant properties in the recorded trajectory data. The resulting coordinate-invariant models can be used for human intent recognition, as well as trajectory generation on the robot from the invariant motion template.

### PhD supervision

Within the context of the Robotgenskill project, I was the co-promotor of two PhD candidates:
- [Arno Verduyn](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0140902) (2020-2025): Analysis, recognition and generalization of human-demonstrated skills using invariant trajectory representations. KU Leuven.
- [Riccardo Burlizzi](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0148800) (2021-2025): Data augmentation in robot learning from demonstration using invariant trajectory representations. KU Leuven.

### Master thesis supervision

During my PhD and PostDoc at KU Leuven, I have mentored and co-supervised over 15 master thesis students in the Master of Mechanical Engineering programme (and the Master of Artificial Intelligence programme).

### Software

For my research on invariant trajectory descriptors, I am developing software packages in Matlab and Python: [invariants_mat](https://github.com/maximvochten/invariants_mat) and [invariants_py](https://github.com/maximvochten/invariants_py).  These packages support the robust numerical calculation of invariant descriptors and also support the generation of trajectories in an invariant way. A corresponding documentation website is being developed: [Trajectory Invariants](https://trajectory-invariants.github.io/).

In my research I frequently make use of the following specialized software libraries for robotics: 
- [eTaSL](https://etasl.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) for task specification and reactive sensor-based control
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) for solving optimal control problems and nonlinear optimization problems
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) for building robotics applications integrating sensing, motion generation, control, and visualization
- [Orocos](https://orocos.org/) for building fast robot controllers

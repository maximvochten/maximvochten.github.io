## About

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate within the <a href='https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/robotics'>Robotics Research Group</a> at <a href='https://www.kuleuven.be'>KU Leuven</a>. My main aim in research is to improve the collaboration between humans and robots by formulating data-efficient task representations that can be used for human intent recognition and for the fast programming of reactive robot motions. To achieve this aim, I combine concepts from numerical optimization, optimal control, differential geometry, screw theory, 3D kinematics, state estimation and robot control.

I am currently working on the [Robotgenskill project](https://robotgenskill.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) which focuses on the generalization of human-demonstrated robot skills.

## Students

I am the co-promotor of two PhD candidates:
- [Arno Verduyn](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0140902). Topic: Analysis, recognition and generalization of human-demonstrated skills using invariant trajectory representations
- [Riccardo Burlizzi](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/0148800). Topic: Data augmentation in robot learning from demonstration using invariant trajectory representations

I have mentored and co-supervised over 15 master thesis students in the Master of Mechanical Engineering programme (and the Master of Artificial Intelligence programme) at KU Leuven.

## Software

For my research on invariant trajectory descriptors, I am developing software packages in Matlab and Python: [invariants_mat](https://github.com/maximvochten/invariants_mat) and [invariants_py](https://github.com/maximvochten/invariants_py).  These packages support the robust numerical calculation of invariant descriptors and also support the generation of trajectories in an invariant way. A corresponding documentation website is being developed: [Trajectory Invariants](https://trajectory-invariants.github.io/).

In my research I frequently make use of the following specialized software libraries for robotics: 
- [eTaSL](https://etasl.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/) for task specification and reactive sensor-based control
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) for solving optimal control problems and nonlinear optimization problems
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) for building robotics applications integrating sensing, motion generation, control, and visualization
- [Orocos](https://orocos.org/) for building fast robot controllers

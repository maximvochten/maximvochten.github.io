From 2014 to 2017 I organized hands-on workshops for building and programming an autonomous mobile robot on a voluntary basis while part of IEEE Student Branch Leuven. These workshops were offered to Engineering Students at KU Leuven as an extracurricular activity. At the end of each academic year I organized a Sumo Robot Competition in which teams of students could participate to win various prizes sponsored by IEEE.

This page intends to gather slides and information for those who are interested in building their own sumo robot.

Workshop topics:
- "Brains": how to program an Arduino microprocessor 
- "Eyes":  how to read out values from optical and distance sensors
- "Muscles": how to control a DC motor
- "Body": how to manufacture a hardware frame using a laser cutter
- "Mind": how to implement a robot control strategy

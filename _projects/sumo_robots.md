From 2016-2018, I organized a series of workshops for Bachelor students to build their own sumo robot and compete in a tourney 

Below you can find pictures and videos of the event.



- "Brains" - programming with Arduino. link-to-slides 
- "Eyes" - 
- "Muscles" - 
- "Body" 
- " " - advanced programming





Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

```python
import treqs as tq
np.array = [1,3]
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">

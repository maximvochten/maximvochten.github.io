      "summary": "I am currently a Postdoc within the Robotics Research Group at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, KU Leuven.\n\nI have been mainly involved in the ERC Advanced Grant ROBOTGENSKILL of Prof. Joris De Schutter, which continues on the research that I did in my PhD. The project's aim was to improve the generalization of human-demonstrated robot skills using invariant representations of the skill. My main research contributions in the project were:\n   1. Proposal of invariant representations for force trajectories, making it possible to learn contact tasks in addition to pure motion tasks\n   2. Implementing receding-window optimization formulations of our invariant methods and integrating them with a reactive robot control framework, bringing our methods closer to real applications.\n   3. Developing practical applications of our methods using real robot manipulator platforms, both in free space (e.g. human-robot object handover) and in contact (e.g. contour tracking). \n   4.  Creating and documenting Python and Matlab software toolboxes that implement our developed methodology.\n\nThis research resulted in several papers in prestigious journals in robotics, and was also presented at the top international conference in robotics.\n\nOther responsibilities:\n- Acting as co-promotor for two PhD researchers within the project\n- Supervision of 10+ master thesis students\n- Scheduling and leading the regular project meetings with the whole team\n- Creating and maintaining the project website\n- Coordinating the efforts of the KU Leuven team within another project, the Flanders Make ICON project PROROB on programming robot tasks in virtual reality (2021-2022).\n- Allocation of didactical tasks among teaching assistants within the division of automation of the department (2019-2023).",

      "summary": "I completed my PhD as part of the Robotics Research Group at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, KU Leuven.\n \nThe topic of my research was on improving the generalization capabilities of motion models in human action recognition and robot learning by demonstration using invariant trajectory representations.  The main contributions were (1) proposing a taxonomy of newly proposed and existing invariant descriptors; and (2) the  use of geometric optimal control to achieve robust calculation of invariants and improve the generalization capabilities of the invariants. This research proved useful to learn invariant models for skill recognition and generation with less data than conventional models.\n\nThese results were published and presented at the top two international conferences in the field of robotics.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, I did a side project on \"time-optimal motion planning under uncertainty for a mobile robot\" for Flanders' Mechatronics Technology Centre (FMTC), now part of Flanders Make.\n\nBesides research, I was also a teaching assistant during this time for the course of Applied Mechanics 3 and the course of Mechanisms and Vibration (Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, KU Leuven). In addition, I supervised three master thesis students.",

Additionally, I presented and demonstrated the application to the general public and jury throughout the 5-day Hannover Messe event."

I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Senior Researcher at the [Royal Military Academy](https://www.rma.ac.be/nl) (RMA) as part of the [Robotics & Autonomous Systems unit](https://mecatron.rma.ac.be/index.php/people/) in the Department of Mechanics. I will lead the team at RMA within the European Defense Funds project [GENIUS](https://mecatron.rma.ac.be/index.php/projects/genius/) on robotic demining. My research activities will involve developing robotic technologies for the perception and safe disposal of mines.
